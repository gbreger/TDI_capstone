# Predicting sales of video game development proposals
The video game industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, with new games coming out every day. The project aims to provide studios and publishers with projections of expected sales to better determine in which proposed video game project should they invest, maximizing their use of resources, financial or otherwise (though arguably, some video games should be made, regardless of their profitability).

## Problem Statement
The video game industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, with new games coming out every day. Some games rack up sales of millions of dollars while others falter. Conversely, games often require a substantial investment to develop and may take years to come to fruition. This project provides game publishers and studios with projections of expected sales of proposed video game projects in order to better determine which projects are indeed worth investing in and to what extent, thereby maximizing the use of their resources, financial or otherwise. The project does so by analyzing historical data of sales of games, from 2010 through 2020, alongside features of these games, such as genres, themes, player perspective, or association with established franchises.
