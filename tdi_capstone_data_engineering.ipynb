Release years and platforms are confined to a certain number of fixed values (e.g., 'pc' or 'ps4' for platforms and 2015 or 2019 for release years). These have already been dealt with above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Names of games, however, can wildly vary. Even the same game can have different spellings of its name (or could have been input differently, e.g., with colons and hyphens, or using digits vs. roman numerals). Instead of a one-to-one match like with release year and platform, names will be matched by closest match. This introduces a couple of complexities. First, the same name can be used by several games, often referring to older/newer releases of a title. So simply finding the closest match would not work, since this would result in finding the (first) closest match in the data set. This also reveals the second caveat here, which is that multiple names in one data set might match most closely to a single name in the other data set.\n",

    "These issues can be solved by making the assumption that in a given year and for a given platform, every game will have a different name.
